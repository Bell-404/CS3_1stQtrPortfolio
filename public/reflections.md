# CS3 Q1 Reflection Questions

## What are 5 topics that I know very well?

    1. Operators

            These make up most of our code, in functions, conditions, loops etc. Arithmetic is for math, Logical is what most of coders use for condition, assignment or other logic uses.

    2. If (+ else) Statements

            Imagine nesting these.
            Basically if a condition is met, the stuff inside this condition will be performed. Sometimes, there will be something **else** done if this condition isn't met (pun intended)

    3. CSS + HTML combo

            It's just website making.

            Frame + design = Website

    4. Loops

            I nest them sometimes

            something will be done as long as a condition is met.
            no infinite loops or a puppy dies
            out of for, while and do while, for loops come in clutch

    5. Basically JavaScript syntax

        had a hard time choosing the last one so
        basically how not to commit any bugs on your code

## What are 5 topics I can still work out on?

    1. Functions

        Functions are fine. But tell me, HOW ARE THEY ABLE TO BE STORED IN VARIABLES?????
        WHY DO I HAVE TO MEMORIZE **4** FUNCTION TYPES?????

    2. Other Variable declarations (anything not let or var)

        Why do strings have no tag?

        I was expecting: 
        
        string/str var variable1;

        but no. It's:

        ```
        var variable1 = "Hello";

        ```

        WHY???????

    3. the extra things that are found on coding exercises and lts

        What do they even mean???????????????????

    4. Array trick shots

        As soon as I started LT2, I knew I needed to do a string var as the output.
        but nooooooooooooooooooooo
        it was an array this whole time.

    5. Other functions

        i never knew var.push() was a thing until LT2

## How to do better on the topics mentioned above?

    Back in my day, when I still had C++, I was allowed to access LGs and Past codes. 

    Now? Pure memorization. Therefore, I will memorize until my brain needs to clean storage.

## What was effective and not effective when doing activities and understanding topics in class?

    When an example is shown, I would put test it using VSCode or any other compiler if necessary. This would come in clutch for me. I would also memorize when an LT was to come (ofc i would)

    What wouldn't work for me however , even without trying was taking hand-written notes. Reading through those notes would be tiring. You would have to analyze the outputs of handwritten code and changing the whole thing if it was wrong. I feel bad for note takers. Remember when I said I would memorize stuff and hopefully do good? Turns out there's also flaws. If I had other things to remember before CS, I would have to memorize too much, which hurts for me btw. So yea.
